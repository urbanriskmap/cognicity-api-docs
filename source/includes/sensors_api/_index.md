# Sensors API

The CogniCity Sensors endpoints supports centralizing data from automated sensor networks. Sensor data can be inserted into the database for storage, and subsequently served as GeoJSON or TopoJSON to support map visualisations.

Sensor locations are point geometries defined using latitude and longitude coordinates in the WGS 1984 coordinate system.

Note that these endpoints reside on a separate sensors subdomain.
