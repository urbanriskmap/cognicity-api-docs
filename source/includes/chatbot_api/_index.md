# Chatbot API

The chatbot API exposes endpoints to receive incoming messages from social media platforms (e.g. via webhooks) and functions to send replies to users (e.g. on succesful report submission). Note that chatbot APIs may run on a custom domain.

The APIs are organised by social media network.
