# Introduction

Welcome to the CogniCity API. CogniCity is the engine that powers Urban Risk Map. You can use this API to access CogniCity data including flood reports and sensor measurements that are stored in the CogniCity database. You can view example requests in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

CogniCity deployments are organised into *instances* for different countries. Currently available instances:

- [PetaBencana](https://petabencana.id)
- [RiskMap US](https://riskmap.us)
- [RiskMap India](https://riskmap.in)

The CogniCity API is accessible via the *data subdomain* of each instance, for example:

- [data.petabencana.id](https://data.petabencana.id)

The CogniCity Sensors API is accessible via the *sensors subdomain* of each instance, for example:

- [sensors.petabencana.id](https://sensors.petabencana.id)
